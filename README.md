# AI-symptoms-checker
The AI Symptom Risk Checker is a healthcare-focused web application designed to assess health risk levels based on user-selected symptoms.  The system uses a rule-based weighted scoring mechanism to perform symptom-based risk stratification. Each symptom is assigned a severity weight, and the cumulative score determines the overall risk category.
